#Design Document for Perontor V1

= Introduction =

This is the design document for V1 of Perontor. This is going to be more "boardgame" focused -> keep things _simple_ and _abstract_ for the time being. This should be easier to manage and allow us to test user interface code, etc for later more ambitious versions of the game. 

Inspirations:
  * chess     - a small set of well defined playing pieces.
  * *go*        - territory control, influence.
  * *diplomacy* - simple rules allowing for interesting player interactions .
  * *solium infernum* - battling over control of certain tiles on the board .
.

Want to keep the number of things in the world low, but large enough for some interesting behaviour (and coding complexity, so we have some re-useable systems). A central mechanic: _controller_ chits (need a better name) spread influence out. Influence allows you to move other units. So a kind of harsh supply mechanic. 

==Chit Types==

===Controller Chits===

  * town - large influence radius, low unit order count
  * general - smaller influence radius, higher unit count. mobile
  * ship - can transport units. influence bonus along coasts


===Other Chits===

  * swords - general purpose combat units
  * knights - faster, better, easily flanked.
  * scouts - don't need influence.
  * builders - don't need influence, can build new towns.
